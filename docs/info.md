## How it works

The 2-to-4 line binary decoder consists of an array of four AND gates. The 2 binary inputs labelled A and B are decoded into one of 4 outputs, hence the description of 2-to-4 binary decoder. Each output represents one of the minterms of the 2 input variables, (each output = a minterm). There is an enable signal, E, which dictates whether all outputs are 1, or a specific output (based on the inputs) is coded as 0. 

## How to test

You test it by running all possible inputs and checking if the outputs match the expected values. Refer to the truth table of an active-high logic 2-4 decoder below. 

When E=1 -> D[3:0]=1

| E | A | B | D3 | D2 | D1 | D0 |
|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
| 0 | 0 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
